# React (with React Native Intro) — 10-Week Course Outline

**Audience:** Students with some basic JavaScript knowledge  
**Duration:** 10 weeks (3–4 hours per week)  
**Format:** Lecture + Live Coding + Guided Labs + Project Work  

---

## Week 1 — JavaScript Recap I: Modern Syntax & Concepts
**Goal:** Refresh JS fundamentals relevant to React.

**Topics:**
- ES6+ essentials: `let`, `const`, arrow functions, template literals
- Objects, arrays, destructuring, spread/rest operators
- Functions, callbacks, promises, and async/await
- `map`, `filter`, `reduce` in React-like contexts

**Lab:**  
Write a small script to filter and display items from a list (e.g., products, tasks) in the console.

---

## Week 2 — JavaScript Recap II: DOM & Modular Thinking
**Goal:** Understand how React replaces manual DOM manipulation.

**Topics:**
- DOM basics: querying elements, event listeners
- Separation of logic and UI
- Modular JS with `import`/`export`
- Why frameworks like React exist

**Lab:**  
Build a small “vanilla JS Todo App” using manual DOM updates — will later be refactored in React.

---

## Week 3 — Getting Started with React
**Goal:** Set up environment and understand React fundamentals.

**Topics:**
- Installing Node.js and npm
- Setting up project (Vite)
- JSX syntax and rendering
- Components and props
- Developer tools & debugging

**Lab:**  
Create a “Hello React” app displaying a personalized greeting using props.

---

## Week 4 — State & Events
**Goal:** Learn how React manages data and reactivity.

**Topics:**
- `useState` hook
- Handling events and user input
- Controlled components (forms, inputs)
- Local vs. global state

**Lab:**  
Build a simple “Counter” app and an input-controlled “Feedback Form.”

---

## Week 5 — Component Composition & Props Drilling
**Goal:** Build reusable and nested components.

**Topics:**
- Passing data between parent and child components
- Conditional rendering
- Lists and keys
- Props drilling & preview of Context API

**Lab:**  
Refactor the “Todo App” from Week 2 using React components.

---

## Week 6 — Side Effects & Data Fetching
**Goal:** Fetch and render external data.

**Topics:**
- `useEffect` hook for lifecycle management
- Fetching data from REST APIs
- Handling loading and error states
- Async/await patterns

**Lab:**  
Create a “User Directory” app fetching mock data from an API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder).

---

## Week 7 — Routing & Component Organization
**Goal:** Enable navigation and scalable project structure.

**Topics:**
- React Router basics (`BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Link`)
- Multi-page app structure
- Organizing components and pages

**Lab:**  
Extend “User Directory” with multiple pages (Home, Users, Details).

---

## Week 8 — Styling & UI Frameworks
**Goal:** Learn to style and structure UI effectively.

**Topics:**
- Inline styles, CSS Modules, Styled Components
- Tailwind CSS basics
- Responsive layout principles

**Lab:**  
Style a previous project using Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules.

---

## Week 9 — React Native Environment & Basics
**Goal:** Understand mobile development with React Native.

**Topics:**
- Installing Android Studio, Xcode, and/or Expo
- React Native vs. React Web differences
- Core components (`View`, `Text`, `Button`, `Image`)
- Running apps in simulator/emulator

**Lab:**  
Set up an Expo app and display “Hello World” on a virtual device.

---

## Week 10 — Capstone Project
**Goal:** Apply full React workflow and optionally test React Native.

**Project Ideas:**
- Task Tracker (Web + optional Native)
- Weather Dashboard
- Movie Browser (API-based)

**Deliverables:**
- Working app (web or native)
- Presentation & code walkthrough
- Short reflection on challenges & takeaways

---

### 🎯 Capstone Project Grading Breakdown (100%)

| **Category** | **Weight** | **Criteria** |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Functionality & Features** | 30% | App runs without major errors, meets project requirements, implements core functionality (data handling, interactivity, routing, etc.). |
| **Code Quality & Structure** | 25% | Clean, well-organized code; proper use of components, hooks, and modular structure; meaningful naming and comments. |
| **UI/UX Design** | 15% | Clear, user-friendly layout; responsive design; consistent styling using CSS/Tailwind. |
| **Data Handling / API Integration** | 10% | Proper API calls (where applicable); good handling of loading, error, and empty states. |
| **Presentation & Documentation** | 10% | Clear explanation of app’s purpose, architecture, and challenges; short in-class demo. |
| **Creativity** | 10% | Any additional features beyond core requirements (e.g., React Native version, animations, context, etc.). |

**Minimum Requirements:**
- App must be functional and built primarily with React.
- Code must be submitted via GitHub.
- Short (5–7 min) presentation and Q&A in final session.

## Optional Add-Ons
- Context API for global state
- Git & GitHub basics
- Deploying React app (Netlify, Vercel)
- Using device APIs in Expo (camera, GPS, etc.)
