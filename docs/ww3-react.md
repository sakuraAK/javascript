# What is React?

React is a **JavaScript library** for building **user interfaces**.  
It allows you to create UI as **components** — reusable parts of the interface — and keeps the UI automatically updated when the underlying data (state) changes.

# React vs HTML + JavaScript

| Feature | HTML + JavaScript (Traditional) | React (Modern) |
|--------|---------------------------------|----------------|
| UI Updates | Must manually change the DOM | UI updates **automatically** when state changes |
| Structure | Logic and UI are scattered | Uses **components** that group UI + logic together |
| Reuse | Limited reuse | **Reusable components** across the app |
| Data Handling | State handled manually | **State + Hooks** simplify data flow |
| Performance | Frequent DOM operations are slow | **Virtual DOM** updates only what's necessary |
| Scalability | Hard to maintain large apps | Designed for **complex, interactive apps** |

# Key Advantages of React
- **Reusable components** → Less repeated code.
- **Automatic UI updates** based on state.
- **Predictable and maintainable structure.**
- **Efficient rendering** using Virtual DOM.
- Works for both **web (React)** and **mobile (React Native)**.
